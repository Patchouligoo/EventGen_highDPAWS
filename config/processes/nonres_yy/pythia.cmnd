! Pythia 8 Configuration File
! Generation of non-resonant proton-proton to photon-photon (pp -> γγ) process

! 1) Settings used in the main program.
Main:numberOfEvents = NEVENTS_PLACEHOLDER  ! number of events to generate
Main:timesAllowErrors = 3                  ! how many aborts before run stops

! 2) Settings related to output in init(), next() and stat().
Init:showChangedSettings = off      ! list changed settings
Init:showChangedParticleData = off  ! list changed particle data
Next:numberCount = 0                ! print message every n events
Next:numberShowInfo = 0             ! Disable event information printout
Next:numberShowProcess = 0          ! Disable process record printout
Next:numberShowEvent = 0            ! Disable event record printout

! 3) Beam parameter settings. Values below agree with default ones.
Beams:idA = 2212                    ! first beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:idB = 2212                    ! second beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:eCM = ECM_PLACEHOLDER         ! CM energy of collision

! 4) Settings for the hard-process generation.
! From Pythia Documentation: In addition to the photons produced in the hard scattering (prompt photons), photons may also be formed in parton showers and hadron decays. Therefore QCD processes might be needed to obtain a realistic rates for photon production.
PromptPhoton:all = off              ! Disable all prompt photon processes
PromptPhoton:gg2gammagamma = on     ! gluon-gluon fusion
PromptPhoton:ffbar2gammagamma = on  ! quark-anti-quark annihilation

! 5) Phase space and cuts (adjust as necessary)
PhaseSpace:pTHatMin = 20.0          ! Minimum pT hat for the hard process
PhaseSpace:mHatMin = 20.0           ! Minimum invariant mass of the diphoton system -> can raise this
